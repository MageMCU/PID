# PID Controller

- A **P**roportional **I**ntegral **D**erivative **Controller** (PID) is a control loop code snippet employing feedback that is widely used in digital control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. 

- A PID controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired set point (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.
