# PID Controller 

- namespace ***pid***

## Controller

PID Controller is under development ... Testing Linear bounded, the following *Circular non-bounded and Polynomial functions* are pending...

## Testing Platform

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

**PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

**Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

Studied several papers and textbooks on PID controllers. It seems each one is different for different applications but finally subtracted-out the most basic elements on the subject... See UpdatePID() for a simple PID.

## In Development

PID controller under development... Will occasionally study Control Theory in my spare time...
