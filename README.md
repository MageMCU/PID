# **PID** Controller

A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. 

A PID controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired set point (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.
