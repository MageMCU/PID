# PID Controller

- A **P**roportional **I**ntegral **D**erivative *Controller* (*PID*) is a control loop *code-snippet* employing feedback that is widely used in digital control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuous control. 

- A PID controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired set point (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.

  - ***e(t) = (SP - PV)(t)*** *where (t) is time, that could be a simple constant loop-tick. A tick is an iteration of some process loop, such as a game loop. In a game loop, for example, the loop tick occurs once every frame but not necessarily at a constant interval of time. Yet the time difference between each tick can be determined during run-time simply taking the difference between each tick often called delta-time. The discrete time intervals called ticks are not the continuous-time of an infinite number of points. The PID with its error function e(t) = (SP -PV)(t) contains a discrete delta-time called the loop-tick.*
